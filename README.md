## Project Overview

This repository implements a comprehensive, research-grade audio watermarking system, designed for robustness, perceptual transparency, and extensibility. The project is structured to support rigorous evaluation against a wide range of attacks, psychoacoustic constraints, and adaptive bit allocation strategies. The codebase is modular, with a focus on reproducibility, testability, and extensibility for future research and industrial use.

### Key Features
- **Parallel Hybrid Model (PHM):** Combines perceptual CNN, technical RNN, and fusion layers for robust watermark embedding and extraction.
- **Psychoacoustic Analysis:** Moore-Glasberg masking model, adaptive bit allocation, and perceptual loss modules for imperceptibility.
- **BCH Error Correction:** Flexible, parameter-optimized error correction for both technical and perceptual branches.
- **Extensive Attack Suite:** Includes augmentations, compression, filtering, and malicious attacks for robustness benchmarking.
- **Test-Driven Development:** All critical modules are covered by detailed, rigorous unit and integration tests.

## Architecture Used

### 1. Parallel Hybrid Model (PHM)
- **Perceptual CNN:** MobileNetV3-based, trained for perceptual quality assessment.
- **Technical RNN:** GRU/Conformer-based, trained for technical robustness.
- **Fusion Layer:** Multi-head attention fusion of perceptual and technical scores.

### 2. Psychoacoustic Pipeline
- **Moore-Glasberg Analyzer:** Computes masking thresholds and critical bands.
- **Adaptive Bit Allocation:** Allocates watermark bits based on perceptual significance.
- **Perceptual Losses:** MFCC, spectral, and temporal losses for imperceptibility.

### 3. Error Correction
- **BCH Codes:** Parameter-optimized, with fallback to repetition coding if reedsolo unavailable.
- **Integration:** Both technical and perceptual branches use BCH for robust embedding.

### 4. Attack Suite
- **Augmentations:** Noise, reverb, time/pitch, background, etc.
- **Compression:** MP3, AAC, OGG, OPUS, variable bitrate, lossy conversion.
- **Filtering:** Low/high/bandpass, notch, equalization, dynamic range, limiter, clipping, phase, comb, harmonic, sample suppression, median filter, resampling, amplitude scaling, quantization, echo addition.
- **Malicious:** Watermark inversion, cut-and-paste, collage, averaging, desynchronization, frequency masking, replacement.

## Mega Tasks Completed

### Task 1.1: Baseline Watermarking
- Basic PHM pipeline implemented (CNN, RNN, fusion).
- Initial psychoacoustic analyzer and loss modules.

### Task 1.2: Robustness and Adaptivity
- **BCH Error Correction:** Fully integrated, parameter-optimized, fallback supported.
- **Adaptive Bit Allocation:** Perceptual significance metric, multiple allocation strategies, and end-to-end integration.
- **Attack Suite:** All required attacks implemented and mapped; simulate.py orchestrates batch and suite runs.
- **STFT Parameter Consistency:** n_fft=1000, hop_length=400 enforced across all psychoacoustic and embedding modules.
- **Test Coverage:**
   - BCH roundtrip (RNN/CNN branches, fallback and error scenarios)
   - Adaptive allocation (shape, sum, forward pass)
   - Attack smoke test (all attacks run, output shape/energy checked)
   - Psychoacoustic pipeline (significance, allocation, loss)
   - All tests reside in `tests/` (unit, integration, benchmark subfolders)

### Pending (for future tasks, not yet started)
- True invertible coupling layers (affine flow)
- Shift/desynchronization robustness
- Acoustic fingerprinting
- Curriculum learning/training
- End-to-end BER/SNR regression under attacks

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```sh
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment (if using one):**
  ```sh
  # Windows
  .\testingEnv\Scripts\activate
  # Linux/macOS
  source testingEnv/bin/activate
  ```
3. **Run all tests:**
  ```sh
  # Run all tests in the project
  python -m pytest tests/ -v
  ```
4. **Run a specific test file:**
  ```sh
  python -m pytest tests/unit/test_task_1_2_bch_and_bit_allocation.py -v
  ```

**All tests are located in the `tests/` folder, organized by type:**
- `tests/unit/` â€” Unit tests for each module (BCH, allocation, attacks, PHM, psychoacoustics)
- `tests/integration/` â€” End-to-end and integration tests
