# ========================================
# Notes:
# ========================================
#
# 1. All distributed training capabilities are built into PyTorch
#    (torch.distributed, torch.multiprocessing)
#
# 2. Audio file support: .wav, .mp3, .flac, .m4a, .ogg
#
# 3. System works with both CPU and CUDA GPUs
#
# 4. wandb is optional but recommended for experiment tracking
#
# 5. BCH error correction is used for robust 1000-bit payload handling
#
# 6. audiomentations and pydub are used by the attacks module for
#    robustness testing during training (via perceptual_losses.py)
#
# 7. Version constraints ensure compatibility:
#    - numpy <1.25.0 for scipy compatibility
#    - urllib3 <2.0.0 for requests compatibility
